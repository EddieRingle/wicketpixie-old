WICKETPIXIE CHANGELOG

v1.0 - June 7, 2008
 * Initial Release

v1.0.1 - June 8, 2008
 * Updated documentation
 * Eliminated activity.php error 
 
v1.0.2 - January 4, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * Updated Source Manager and Faves Manager for Wordpress 2.7+
 as well as leaving it backwards compatible with Wordpress 2.5+
 * Fixed the activity stream, it now shows your activity stream!
 * UI improvements to certain WicketPixie forms. For example,
 if a source has no feed associated, it will show "N/A" on the
 Sources Manager page. Also, you can't flush non-feed streams,
 so the buttons to flush them have been removed.

v1.0.3 - January 7, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * Now only the wicketpixie folder is required, and everything
 has been either automated or moved into the theme folder,
 making things much easier on the user.
 * Added a footer notice in the admin area including the current
 version of WicketPixie.
 * More UI improvements, now the all the admin pages WicketPixie
 adds load much faster and do not halt in the middle of loading.
 * Updated SimplePie version.

IN PROGRESS - January 18, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * Fixed a few CSS issues
